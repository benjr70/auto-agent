# auto-agent

A reusable autonomous agent harness: a Daemon that picks up `AFK` issues in a
Target Project and drives each one to a merged PR. Extracted from
Smart-Smoker-V2. Vocabulary is in `CONTEXT.md`; decisions are in `docs/adr/`.

## Layout

- `bin/auto-agent`: the CLI engine Setup drives (ADR 0009).
  `check-config <target-dir>` validates a Target Project's Harness config;
  `show-config <target-dir>` prints the resolved JSON every lib reads;
  `fire [--dry-run] [<target-dir>]` runs one Fire.
- `lib/`: the bash libs the Daemon runs from, each with a `*.test.sh` suite.
  `harness-config.sh` is the only reader of `.auto-agent/harness.json`;
  `host-env.sh` reads the Host env; `fire.sh` is the Fire wrapper;
  `rate-limits-tap.sh` records the stream's rate-limit events;
  `fire-record.sh` writes the Fire record. `testdata/` holds canned streams.
- `plugin/`: the Claude Code plugin a Fire loads with `--plugin-dir` (ADR 0001).
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the manifest; `skills/` the namespaced
  `/auto-agent:<name>` skills; `settings/baseline.json` the `--settings`
  baseline (env, permissions, deny list) every Fire carries;
  `schema/` holds the Harness config JSON schema and its jq validator;
  `fixtures/target-project/` is the fixture Target Project the harness tests
  itself against.
- `run-tests.sh`: runs every `*.test.sh` and `*.test.py` suite; the one entry
  point CI calls.

## Harness config

A Target Project commits one `.auto-agent/` directory (ADR 0002):
`harness.json` for the machine, validated against
`plugin/schema/harness.schema.json` at Setup and before every Fire, and
fixed-name markdown siblings (`verifier-runbook.md`, `bot-pr-checklist.md`,
`deployed-checks.md`) for prose. An optional executable `host-extension` adds
project-specific Host needs at Setup time. The default branch is detected from
GitHub, never declared. See `plugin/fixtures/target-project/.auto-agent/` for
a complete example.

```sh
bin/auto-agent check-config plugin/fixtures/target-project
bash run-tests.sh
```

## A Fire

`bin/auto-agent fire` runs one Daemon pass against a Target Project: it
validates the Harness config (failing closed), runs `claude -p` with
`--plugin-dir plugin`, `--settings plugin/settings/baseline.json` and
`--output-format stream-json`, pipes the stream through the rate-limit tap,
and writes a Fire record when the Fire ends, failed ones included. Everything
lands in the State dir, `AUTO_AGENT_STATE_DIR` from the Host env
(`~/.config/auto-agent/env`), defaulting to `~/.local/state/auto-agent`:

- `fires/<fire-id>.json`: the Fire record (start, kind, issue, exit, plugin
  loaded, result, last rate-limit event, Gate verdict). The Dashboard's input.
- `rate-limits.json` / `rate-limits.jsonl`: the last and every
  `rate_limit_event` the tap saw (ADR 0008 addendum).
- `logs/<fire-id>.stream.jsonl` and `.stderr.log`: the raw transcript.

`fire --dry-run` runs the no-op `/auto-agent:dry-run` skill, against the
fixture Target Project when no target is given, and exits 0 only when the
stream's init event lists the plugin and the skill and the skill printed
`dry-run: ok`. It is the Fire seam Setup's verify stage and the harness's own
tests demo on.

```sh
AUTO_AGENT_STATE_DIR=/tmp/aa-state bin/auto-agent fire --dry-run
```
